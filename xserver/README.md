# X11 Library 
A collection of tools to simplify high-level interaction with X11, specifically
windows, and if they are in focus for simple scripting and more complex
applications leveraging X11.

Since I'm actually using wayland this is using XWayland to develop against; it
would be nice to have an X11 library and a wayland library but that makes no
sense yet. 

Before that it would make more sense to push this as its own module since its
independent of the above module. And this could find use otherwise but I want to
focus on core functionality of streamkit.
